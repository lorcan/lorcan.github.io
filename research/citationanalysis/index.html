<h1>Correlation between ISI Impact Factor and Google Scholar Impact Factor for Selected Journals</h1>
There is a strong correlation between citation counts computed from Google Scholar data and comparable data from the ISI Web of Knowledge index, validating the use of our new Google Scholar Impact Factor as an alternative citation-based evaluation metric applicable to both journals and conferences. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two is 0.86. The table below shows the raw values.

<h1><a name="scatterplot"/>Scatterplot of Available Rejection Rates versus Google Scholar Impact Factors</h1>
Below is a scatter plot of GS impact factor against conference rejection rates for 23 conferences across the 15 conference series we evaluated; note the data points reflect a subset of the full set of conferences, namely those for which we were able to obtain. Reliable rejection rates could not be obtained for all of the conferences for which we had data. <a href="#rejectionrates">More details on the rejection rates we used are below</a>. While our study indicate some correlation between GS impact factor and rejection rates, the related Pearson correlation score of 0.53 was not very convincing and reflects considerable variation when it comes to the relationship between conference rejection rates and a conference paper’s ability to attract citations. There are conferences with similar rejection rates but very different Google Scholar impact factors. There are also conferences with very different rejection rates that still manage to achieve similar GS impact factors. For instance, AAAI achieves a Google Scholar impact factor of 20, with a rejection rate of 65%–75%. Its European counterpart, ECAI the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, is just as selective but achieves a median GS impact factor of only 7 (see <a href="#regionalbias">the section on regional bias below</a>).

Another example of a lack of correlation between paper acceptance rate and citation count is the 2002 European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ECCBR), which had a rejection rate of approximately 0.33 33% and Google Scholar impact factor of 7, achieving a citation rate better than the European Conference on Machine Learning?? 2000 and ECAI 2002, which had twice its rejection rate (see <a href="#openworld">the Section below on open-world versus closed-world bias</a>).

To further test the strength of the correlation between GS impact factor and rejection rate we examined the available data for three conference series that took place between 2000-2003; UAI, ICML, and ECML were the only conferences that occurred and had published rejection rates available in every year of the study. Table 5 outlines the GS impact factors and rejection rates for each year in the study. What is interesting here is there is no significant correlation between rejection rate and GS impact factor. The Pearson score for UAI is was?? only 0.27, for ICML 0.24, and for ECML 0.42. This suggests that, at least for these conferences, the yearly changes in rejection rates had little bearing on expected citation count.
These results highlight the assumption?? the fact?? that any assumed relationship between conference rejection rates and a conference’s ability to attract citations is at best weak, so other factors play a more critical role when it comes to influencing future citations.

<h1><a name="regionalbias">International versus Local Venues</a></h1>
We found evidence of strong regional bias between similar conferences, with international (mainly U.S.-centric) conferences attracting much higher citation counts that their similarly selective though less-well-cited European counterparts. Both the AAAI and ECAI conferences target the same research area and attract submissions from a similar community of researchers in a way that is equally selective. Yet the U.S.-centric AAAI enjoys an expected citation count (computed from the product of the median citation count and the rejection rate of the conference) more than twice that of ECAI.

This apparent regional bias is also evident in another pair of related conferences: the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and ECML. Once again, a more U.S.-centric ICML conference series attracts far more citations—twice as many—than a similarly selective Euro-centric ECML conference series. There are several possible explanations: One is that non-European researchers are likely to miss publications at European venues (such as ECAI and ECML), so papers at these conferences pick up references only from European researchers. Another is that a pre-selection process allows researchers to keep their best work for the international conference.

There does not appear to be a case for bias between the International and European Conferences on Case  Based Reasoning, although these conferences are held on alternative years, and in ICCBR was held in Norway in 2003. This table is here only because we have the data to show it.

<h1><a name="openworld">Open versus Closed World Venues</a></h1>
The table below shows a breakdown of the GS Impact Factor count of ECCBR (formally known as EWCBR) versus ECAI. The European Conference on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) ranked almost as highly in 2000 and 2002 as the European Conference on AI conference, which has a much higher rejection rate. This suggests that there is some merit in targeting one's own community and publishing in niche conferences rather than the larger conferences with a more general audience. However, there is not enough evidence here to draw strong conclusions.
