Poornima Hanumara developed the <a href="/neardear">Near Dear</a> project as her ODCSSS project in summer of 2008 under the supervision of <a href="/research">Lorcan Coyle</a>. The original project title was <a href="http://www.odcsss.ie/10.html">Connecting Families by Sharing the Minutiae of their Lives</a> - it called for an ambient/pervasive/ubiquitous technology for helping family members keep in touch with each other using micro-blogging tools (e.g., using <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>). Originally we looked at using Nabaztags (thanks <a href="http://www.stabeler.com/nabaztag/">Matt</a>), but eventually settled on using <a href="http://www.chumby.com/">Chumbys</a>.

The motivation for Near Dear was that members of a family have different degrees of familiarity and comfort with using technology. While some members of the family do not have access to a computer very often and are not familiar with micro-blogging, for others Internet is the main medium for keeping-in-touch. Near Dear bridges this gap by using Chumby, which sits in an accessible place at home and makes microblogging easy and convenient for computer-novices. We completed a small user study shows that the Near Dear widget is intuitive and serves the purpose of making Twittering more convenient. The Near Dear Chumby widget was released as <a href="http://www.chumby.com/guide/widget/Near+Dear">a beta on the Chumby Network in July 2008 and is available to install on any Chumby</a>. The project is documented on the <a href="http://neardear.org/">Near Dear website</a>. The project is being maintained and if anyone wants to collaborate on it going forward we'd love to hear from you :-)

<h2>In the News</h2>
Before leaving Texas, <a href="http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2008/may/16/utd-students-head-ireland-summer-research-program/">Pegasus News ran an article on Poornima's success at winning a place in ODCSSS 2008 and wished her luck</a>. During the project, one of the Dublin newspapers, <a href="http://www.herald.ie/national-news/wireless-rabbit-to-monitor-your-childs-web-use-1435303.html">the Herald, wrote an article on Near Dear at an early stage of the project's development</a> when we were playing with Nabaztags. The project was also mentioned in <a href="http://www.dcu.ie/news/2008/jul/s0708f.shtml">a DCU news release after the mid-term review day</a>, and <a href="http://www.science.ie/EN/index.cfm/section/news/news_key/617">in science.ie, a popular Irish science website</a>.
