  Over the last semester, the students of <a href="http://csimoodle.ucd.ie/moodle/course/view.php?id=49">Comp30050</a> have been working on their collaborative software engineering projects. At the start of the module, students choose their own team mates and propose their own projects. They set milestones for themselves, which are used to grade their progress. On April 24th they ran demos of their completed systems for the department to see. Eight teams demonstrated their technology – photos from each demonstration are shown below (and in <a href="http://lorcancoyle.org/category/image-galleries/comp30050-2008-demo-day">the gallery</a>). Thanks to all who attended and to the demonstrators: Graham Williamson, Ross Foley, Matt DiFranco, Ross Shannon, the teaching assistant Mohan Singh, and all the students who put so much work into the course. - Lorcan Coyle, Benoit Gaudin, and Joe Kiniry.

<h1><a name="tuneblaster">Tuneblaster</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/Ahmed_Alex_TuneBlaster_small.preview.JPG" alt="Tuneblaster on the big screen"/>
Hugh Corrigan, Ahmed Warreth (pictured above, left, watching CSI’s Alexander Ufimtsev play Tuneblaster), Dermot Kirby and Daniel Barrington developed an original puzzle game through Microsoft's XNA framework, which allowed their game to be played using a gamepad on a PC or Xbox 360. The game combines physics-based game play with explosive particle effects and music which adapts to the player's skill, so that good play is rewarded with more dynamic melodies and the addition of extra musical instruments to the game's soundtrack.

<h1><a name="hindenburg">Project Hindenburg</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/Hindenburg_small.preview.JPG" alt="Team Hindenburg"/>
Cillian Murphy, John Hannon, Donal Troddyn, and Semir Aliefendic (pictured left to right) worked on the ambitious goal of providing control systems for an autonomous blimp. They aimed to use Gumstix computers and GPS to get the current location of the blimp and to calculate its course. They would then power servos and motors in order for the blimp to follow that course.

<h1><a name="kinephon">Kinephon</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/Kinephon_small.preview.JPG" alt="Team Kinephon showing off Kinephon"/>
Jakub Dostal, Eliott Bartley, David Swords, Sumbo Ajisafe, and Eva Darulova (pictured left to right - Eva Darulova is not pictured) built a system that, using a Nintendo Wiimote, tracks infrared LEDs attached to gloves worn by a user. The application then produces appropriate musical compositions that match the dance movements of the user. These compositions are based on various data collected from the Wiimote such as, position, direction, speed and shape matching data.

<h1><a name="self-checkout">Self-checkout</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/Check-out_small.preview.JPG" alt="Team Self-Checkout showing off their system"/>
Gráinne Mulligan, Deirdre Power, Peter Gibney and Patrick McDonagh (pictured left to right) built a self check-out system similar to those found in supermarkets but with a number of additional features. The system included the usual bar code scanning (using a webcam) and weight checking. Product and user information was stored in a database. Additional features included user specific allergy data on products, recipe suggestions, web based reminder setting and emailed receipts.

<h1><a name="autocock">Automatic Cocktail Maker></a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/AutoCock_small.preview.JPG" alt="Team Dragon showing off their Automatic Cocktail Maker"/>
Alex Rankin, David Fagan, Lar Judge, and Alistair Wilson (pictured left to right) were out to set the standard for cocktails in Dublin. They built an automatic cocktail maker, which could mix, stir and provide ice for drinks using the Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics kit, Bluetooth, and the Lejos JVM for Mindstorms NXT. Bar staff or customers could use a GUI to select a cocktail from a list of drinks and their system then carries out appropriate actions to produce the cocktail.

<img src="/files/images/Superblog_small.preview.JPG" alt="Team Superblog"/>
Matthew Boyle, David Kelly, Eoghan McEvoy, Kevin McNally, and Peter Morgan (pictured left to right - Peter Morgan is not pictured) collaborated to develop a mobile phone blogging application on the Google Android platform. Their application allows for users to log into the popular Blogger service, retrieve blog feeds using the Atom protocol, and create and edit blog posts.

<h1><a name="drought">Drought – a Real Time Strategy Game</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/drought_small.preview.jpg" alt="Team Drought"/>
Eoin Murphy, Rashid Bhamjee, Eugene Kenny, and Eoin Cunnife used Microsoft's XNA games platform to develop a networked real-time 3D strategy game with a novel twist. The game takes place on an arid planet where the most crucial natural resource is water. Rain falls during the night, requiring the player to send their units into the fray each morning to collect and defend more of the water that has pooled than their opponent in order to build up a winning fighting force.

<h1><a name="musiccomparison">Music Comparison</a></h1>
<img src="/files/images/BrianHarty_MarcWhelan_DudleyStuart-Murphy_PaulMcgrath_MusicComparison_small.preview.jpg" alt="Team Music Comparison"/>
Brian Harty, Marc Whelan, Dudley Stuart-Murphy, Paul McGrath, and Peter O’Murchu (pictured left to right, Marc Whelan in front, Peter O'Murchu is not pictured) developed a piece of software for comparing the MP3s stored in two different file systems. They used an ID3 library to extract MP3 information such as artist and bit rate and put this into a database. Regular expressions were used to compare the entries in each file system and the user was presented with the information in a GUI.

<h1><a name="sportspredictionleague">Sports Prediction League</a></h1>
Mark Costello, Oísín McDermott, Alan McPhillips, and Sean Tracey implemented an online game whose purpose is to bet on sport matches (rugby, soccer, football, etc). The more bets you win, the more points you get. Each player can create an account, bet online and consult match results and players' ranking. To reach their goal, the team used technology such as Apache, PHP and MySQL.

<h1><a name="alexandria">Alexandria</a></h1>
Ryan Gannon, Thomas Higgins, and Amal Modibbo developed Project Alexandria, a web-based library management system built using PHP and MySQL. Their system is unique because it provides robust book search using Amazon and ISBNDB.com, two of the most thorough web-accessible book databases. In addition, their system is cross-platform, scalable, and open-source.
