    <h1>Real-time Anomaly Identification</h1>
    <p>Many companies have large customer datasets with network structure, e.g. financial transaction datasets or mobile-phone call networks. Due to their sheer size and complexity, it is often difficult to understand the relationships within the datasets. For example, what are the typical classes of customers, their prevalence within the dataset and their defining characteristics? Who are the unusual or anomalous customers with respect to their behavior and characteristics? These questions are fundamental to fraud detection and customer analytics.</p>
    <p>EgoNav is a tool for identifying recurring patterns and anomalous structure in large datasets. It performs a parallel analysis of all customers in real-time. It allows a user to interactively browse the dataset, highlighting typical classes of customers and unusual or suspicious activity. We can demonstrate an existing prototype and outline its development plan for the next twelve months. The tool is under active development with a particular focus on handling large and real-time datasets. We are also keen to incorporate particular requirements from potential industrial partners at this stage to make the tool directly applicable to their needs.</p>
    <p>EgoNav is being developed within <a href="http://www.cliquecluster.org/">Clique</a>, a Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded research group focused on network analysis and visualization based in University College Dublin (UCD). It has been funded to date by Enterprise Ireland.</p>

    <h2>Lorcan Coyle</h2><br />
    <p>Dr. Coyle is responsible for all technical development in EgoNav. Before this, his career was primarily as a university researcher, with a focus on the development of algorithms for machine learning, software engineering (in particular to software evolution), and user-modelling.
