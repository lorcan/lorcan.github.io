  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>As the ubiquity and complexity of software increase, a requirement
	has emerged for critical software that can successfully evolve without
	loss of quality – software that is engineered from the start to
	be easily changed, extended, and reconfigured, while retaining its
	security, its performance, and its reliability and predictability.


	The articles in this EssentialSet bring together the perspectives
	of key software engineering researchers and practitioners who both
	influence their organizations and evaluate the emerging practice
	of developing these new systems.</p>

  <p>Increasingly software can be considered to be critical, due to the

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Though computer scientists agree that conference publications enjoy
	greater status in computer science than in other disciplines, there
	is little quantitative evidence to support this view. The importance
	of journal publication in academic promotion makes it a highly personal
	issue, since focusing exclusively on journal papers misses many significant
	papers published by CS conferences.


	Here, we aim to quantify the relative importance of CS journal and
	conference papers, showing that CS papers in leading conferences
	match the impact of papers in mid-ranking journals and surpass the
	impact of papers in journals in the bottom half of the Thompson Reuters
	rankings (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for impact measured in terms
	of citations in Google Scholar. We also show that poor correlation
	between this measure and conference acceptance rates indicates conference
	publication is an inefficient market where venues equally challenging
	in terms of rejection rates offer quite different returns in terms
	of citations.


	How to measure the quality of academic research and performance of
	particular researchers has always involved debate. Many CS researchers
	feel that performance assessment is an exercise in futility, in part
	because academic research cannot be boiled down to a set of simple
	performance metrics, and any attempt to introduce them would expose
	the entire research enterprise to manipulation and gaming. On the
	other hand, many researchers want some reasonable way to evaluate
	academic performance, arguing that even an imperfect system sheds
	light on research quality, helping funding agencies and tenure committees
	make more informed decisions.


	One long-standing way of evaluating academic performance is through
	publication output. Best practice for academics is to write key research
	contributions as scholarly articles for submission to relevant journals
	and conferences; the peer-review model has stood the test of time
	in determining the quality of accepted articles. However, today’s
	culture of academic publication accommodates a range of publication
	opportunities yielding a continuum of quality, with a significant
	gap between the lower and upper reaches of the continuum; for example,
	journal papers are routinely viewed as superior to conference papers,
	which are generally considered superior to papers at workshops and
	local symposia. Several techniques are used for evaluating publications
	and publication outlets, mostly targeting journals. For example,
	Thompson Reuters (the Institute for Scientific Information) and other
	such organizations record and assess the number of citations accumulated
	by leading journals (and some high-ranking conferences) in the ISI
	Web of Knowledge (http://www.isiknowledge.com) to compute the impact
	factor of a journal as a measure of its ability to attract citations.
	Less-reliable indicators of publication quality are also available
	for judging conference quality; for example, a conference’s rejection
	rate is often cited as a quality indicator on the grounds that a
	high rejection rate means a more selective review process able to
	generate higher-quality papers. However, as the devil is in the details,
	the details in this case vary among academic disciplines and subdisciplines.


	Here, we examine the issue of publication quality from a CS/engineering
	perspective, describing how related publication practices differ
	from those of other disciplines, in that CS/engineering research
	is mainly published in conferences rather than in journals. This
	culture presents an important challenge when evaluating CS research
	because traditional impact metrics are better suited to evaluating
	journal rather than conference publications.


	In order to legitimize the role of conference papers to the wider
	scientific community, we offer an impact measure based on an analysis
	of Google Scholar citation data suited to CS conferences. We validate
	this new measure with a large-scale experiment covering 8,764 conference
	and journal papers to demonstrate a strong correlation between traditional
	journal impact and our new citation score. The results highlight
	how leading conferences compare favorably to mid-ranking journals,
	surpassing the impact of journals in the bottom half of the traditional
	ISI Web of Knowledge ranking. We also discuss a number of interesting
	anomalies in the CS conference circuit, highlighting how conferences
	with similar rejection rates (the traditional way of evaluating conferences)
	can attract quite different citation counts. We also note interesting
	geographical distinctions in this regard, particularly with respect
	to European and U.S. conferences.</p>

  <p>The rise of the Internet, the ever increasing ubiquity of data, and

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Detecting human activities from sensors deployed in the environment
	is a difficult problem. Human activities are so varied that it is
	difficult to match sensed activities to observed actions. Instrumented
	homes have proved a popular platform for such sensors but experiences
	there show how challenging it can be. We believe that the pool hall
	is a more useful platform for the deployment of body-mounted sensor
	networks as the motions that can be captured correlate well to the
	activities that take place on the pool table. The problem is more
	narrow than detecting human activities in general. We will focus
	on a simple sensor, mounted on the cue, which is important as the
	cue is the sole actuator used to play the game. By correlating the
	force with which a player strikes the ball with their cue and the
	distance the ball travels we demonstrate that with a simple off-the-shelf
	sensor we can derive useful information. We conclude by describing
	a set of enhancements that enable a computer to “sense” the game
	of pool.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The area of activity identification is maturing well in the HCI and
	ubiquitous computing fields. However, although algorithm development
	is proceedings well, without publicly available datasets on which
	to compare results it is difficult to consolidate the disparate work
	being done. This problem exists because realistic datasets describing
	human activity are difficult and expensive to gather and because
	there are significant barriers to releasing the data once gathered.
	We review positive recent development with the release of two high-quality
	datasets. From our experiences using these datasets we list some
	recommendations for the gathering and release of future datasets.
	Finally, we propose a strategy of our own for gathering a new dataset
	from these recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Highly sensorised systems present two parallel challenges: how to
	design a sensor suite that can efficiently and cost-effectively support
	the needs of given services; and to extract the semantically relevant
	interpretations, or "situations", from the flood of context data
	collected by the sensors. We describe mathematical structures called
	situation lattices that can be used to address these two problems
	simultaneously, allowing designers to both design and refine situation
	identification whilst offering insights into the design of sensor
	suites. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our technique
	against a third-party data set and demonstrate how it can be used
	to evaluate sensor suite designs.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Through advances in sensing technology, a huge amount of data is available

	of this data that correlate to high-level human activities. Time,
	while being semantically rich and an essentially free source of information,
	has not received sufficient attention for this task. In this paper,
	we examine the potential for taking temporal features - inherent

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>In the domain of ubiquitous computing, the ability to identify the
	occurrence of situations is a core function of being ’context-aware’.
	Given the uncertain nature of sensor information and inference rules,
	reasoning techniques that cater for uncertainty hold promise for
	enabling the inference process. In our work, we apply the Dempster
	Shafer theory of evidence to infer situation occurrence with minimal
	use of training data. We describe a set of evidential operations

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Much research on context quality in context-aware systems divides
	into two strands: (1) the qualitative identification of quality measures
	and (2) the use of uncertain reasoning techniques. In this paper,
	we combine these two strands, exploring the problem of how to identify
	and propagate quality through the different context layers in order
	to support the context reasoning process. We present a generalised,
	structured context quality model that supports aggregation of quality
	from sensor up to situation level. Our model supports reasoning processes
	that explicitly aggregate context quality, by enabling the identification
	and quantification of appropriate quality parameters. We demonstrate
	the efficacy of our model using an experimental sensor data set,
	gaining a significant improvement in situation recognition for our
	voting based reasoning algorithm.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>There are few areas of modern life in which software is not an important
	(though often invisible) component. The software in our lives is
	increasingly complex; its interaction with the real world means that
	its requirements are in a state of constant change (Lehman & Fernández-Ramil,
	2006). Many non-software products and services, from healthcare to
	transport, education to business, depend on reliable, high-quality
	software.


	Software engineering is the activity that applies engineering principles
	to software. It applies systematic, rigorous discipline to the design
	and development of software, much as civil engineering does to construction.
	Software engineering improves the quality, reliability and predictability
	of software systems, by generating knowledge, tools and processes
	that both facilitate and improve the software development process.
	These qualities are essential wherever software failure might lead
	to significant safety, security, or economic losses.


	Software systems frequently need to be modified in response to changes
	in system requirements and in their operational environment (Swanson,
	1976). Such modification may involve the addition of new functionality,
	the adjustment of existing functions, or the wholesale replacement
	of entire sub-systems. All such change is fraught with uncertainty
	— software projects involving change frequently fail to meet requirements,
	run over time and budget, or are abandoned (Rajlich and Bennett,
	2000). As the ubiquity and complexity of software increase, a requirement
	has emerged for critical software which can successfully evolve without
	loss of quality — software that is engineered from the start to
	be easily changed, extended and reconfigured, while retaining its
	security, its performance, its reliability and predictability.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>While it is universally held by computer scientists that conference
	publications have a higher status in computer science than in other
	disciplines there is little quantitative evidence in support of this
	position. The importance of journal publications in academic promotion
	makes this a big issue since a focus on journal papers only will
	miss many significant papers published at conferences in computer
	science. In this paper we set out to quantify the relative importance
	of journal and conference papers in computer science. We show that
	computer science papers in leading conferences match the impact of
	papers in mid-ranking journals and surpass the impact of papers in
	journals in the bottom half of the ISI rankings - when impact is
	measured by citations in Google Scholar. We also show that there
	is a poor correlation between this measure of impact and conference
	acceptance rates. This indicates that conference publication is an
	inefficient market where venues that are equally challenging in terms
	of rejection rates offer quite different returns in terms of citations.</p>

  <p>Applications that rely on mobile devices for user interaction must

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Context-aware systems typically use data sensed from the environment
	to drive adaptive behaviour. Sensed data is inherently imprecise
	and uncertain; in addition, new uncertainties are introduced when
	sensed data is fused with other data to infer context at the more
	abstract level of situations. We present an uncertainty model which
	aggregates context uncertainty and provides mechanisms to capture
	uncertainty at situation level. We demonstrate the application of
	the model in a sample scenario using an experimental data set.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Stock photo libraries are the most common means for publishers and
	advertisers to find images for their media. Searching for the perfect
	photo can be a time-consuming and frustrating task. This is because
	searching is often dependent on the descriptors or tags given to
	each photo by the editors and contributors to the library. The tagging
	process is subjective, further complicating the search process. We
	describe an algorithm that uses domain ontologies to improve the
	interactions with these libraries. Ontologies are used to expand
	query terms based on users’ initial search queries. We present results
	that demonstrate that the use of ontologies greatly improves users
	ability to retrieve photos when undertaking a number of search tasks.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>It is becoming difficult to convey information from an ever-increasing
	number of digital sources to users in a condensed and meaningful
	way. This growth has particularly occurred with peripheral information
	sources. These are of general interest to users, but do no require
	or typically command constant focus or attention. Examples include
	weather, stock data, blogs, and calendars. Ambient Displays present
	information unobtrusively in an intelligent fashion using abstract
	visual cues and metaphors and have the possibility of acting as a
	complement to information filtering systems. We describe the implementation
	of an ambient display that contains elements representing time, weather,
	public transport departure times, and the proximity of friends. An
	initial impact study was undertaken and found a high sense of usefulness
	and curiosity in the finished application and in the field as a whole.</p>

  <p>Situations, the semantic interpretations of context, provide a better

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Pervasive computing is typically highly sensor-driven, but sensors
	provide only evidence of fact rather than facts themselves. The uncertainty
	of sensor data will affect each component in a pervasive computing
	system, which may decrease the quality of its provided services.
	We provide a general model to represent semantics of uncertainty
	in different levels (e.g., sensor, lower-level context and higher-level
	context). Within our model, fine-grained approaches are applied to
	evaluate and propagate uncertainties. They will help to resolve the
	uncertainty in each process of context management so that the effect
	of uncertainty on system services will be minimised.</p>

  <p>Context-aware systems that rely on mobile devices for user interaction

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Pervasive computing is by its nature open and extensible, and must
	integrate information from a diverse range of sources. This leads
	to a problem of information exchange, so sub-systems must agree on
	shared representations. Ontologies potentially provide a well-founded
	mechanism for the representation and exchange of such structured
	information. A number of ontologies have been developed specifically
	for use in pervasive computing, none of which appears to cover adequately
	the space of concerns applicable to application designers. We compare
	and contrast the most popular ontologies, evaluating them against
	the system challenges generally recognised within the pervasive computing
	community. We identify a number of deficiencies that must be addressed
	in order to apply ontological techniques successfully to next-generation
	pervasive systems.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>With the general increase of life span that our advances in health
	care have afforded us, more people are suffering from short term

	in dangerous situations, such as leaving the stove on and leaving

	a reader in the palm. The RFID glove reads the tags on the nearby
	objects. Along with the RFID glove we are developing an application
	that enables the user to interact with a reminder application. The
	application alerts the user of important activities they may have

  <p>Construct differs from other pervasive systems platforms in a number

	a knowledge-centric model of interaction where clients’ actions are
	driven by queries and triggers about the context of the system. It
	uses gossiping to maintain a consistent state across a distributed
	data structure, which maximises robustness and scalability and avoids
	many problems with hot-spots and hot-paths in communications. Finally,
	it treats all information sources uniformly as sensors acting as

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Smart homes are sensor-rich environments that contain dynamic sets
	of interacting components. These components often use competing and
	closed standards and form a message-based architecture. This complicates
	the development of applications that require information from disparate
	sources. It becomes difficult to add new components or to allow components
	from different applications to interact with each another. In this
	paper we describe Construct, a pervasive computing middleware that
	is ideally suited for deployment in the smart home. Construct acts
	as a sensor fusion layer that takes output from each smart home component
	and makes it available to all applications. This makes it easy to
	develop applications that require access to heterogeneous sources
	of sensor data, and to add sensors to existing systems to improve
	their performance. This paper demonstrates two Construct-enabled
	smart home applications and shows how access to new sensors leads
	to improvements in their performance.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Location detection systems that use tags are a popular means of determining
	a user’s location. These systems are characterised as requiring the
	user to carry an identity tag that is detected by sensors, which
	typically use some form of triangulation to determine location. Although
	estimates for precision for these systems are published by the respective
	manufacturers the customer experience can vary widely. This paper
	proposes an evaluation framework which will allow different systems
	to be compared more directly. This framework is specifically targeted
	at evaluating the experiences of tagging humans, which can cause
	particular difficulties due to the fact that many tag-based systems
	use communication frequencies that cannot pass easily through the
	human body.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Location-aware systems provide customised services or applications
	according to users’ locations. While much research has been carried
	out in developing models to represent location information and spatial
	relationships, it is usually limited to modelling simple environments
	(cf. [13,19,3]). This paper proposes a unified space model for more
	complex environments (e.g., city plan or forest). This space model
	provides a flexible, expressive, and powerful spatial representation.
	It also proposes a new data structure - an integrated lattice and
	graph model - to express comprehensive spatial relationships. This
	structure not only provides multiple graphs at different abstraction
	levels, but it also collapses the whole map into smaller local graphs.
	This mechanism is beneficial in reducing the complexity of creating
	and maintaining a map and improving the efficiency of path finding
	algorithms.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Conversational recommender systems have recently emerged as useful

	given their ability to expose a user’s current preferences. These
	systems use conversational feedback to hone in on the most suitable

	that incorporates information about the individual performance of
	neighbours during a recommendation session, into the neighbour retrieval

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Context awareness in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems has become
	a topic of increased research of late. In CBR, context serves as
	a major source for reasoning, decision-making, and adaptation. Achieving
	context-awareness for context-sensitive CBR systems will depend on
	their ability to represent and manipulate in formation about a rich
	range of contextual factors. These factors may include not only physical
	characteristics of the task environment, but many other aspects such
	as the knowledge states (of both the application and user), and user
	beliefs and emotions. There presentation and reasoning problem therein
	presents research challenges to which numerous methods and techniques
	derived from artificial intelligence and knowledge management (e.g.,
	logical reasoning, object relationship models, ontologies, similarity
	measures, and intelligent retrieval mechanisms) are now being brought
	to bear.

	This workshop served as a discussion platform to researchers and practitioners
	exploring issues and approaches for context-sensitive systems involving
	CBR to share their problems and techniques. The discussion extended
	towards mechanisms and techniques for structured storage of contextual
	information, effective ways to retrieve, reuse, and adapt it, as
	well as methods for enabling integration of context and application
	knowledge. The main question raised at the workshop is how to deal
	with contextual and/or contextualized in formation, e.g., contextualized
	cases for a CBR system. To kickstart this discussion, three selected
	papers we represented, which opened the discussions with specific
	questions about context-awareness, explanations, and context ontology
	issues.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The concept of calm technology, introduced by Mark Weiser, has led
	researchers from several disciplines to explore new and unconventional
	ways of conveying information. Some well-known examples of such novel
	information techniques include Ambient Devices’ Stock Orb, Koert
	van Mensvoort’s Datafountain, Violet’s Nabaztag, Jafarinami et al.’s
	Breakaway, Mynatt et al.’s Audio Aura and Digital Family Portrait,
	Mankoff et al.’s Daylight Display and BusMobile, and Natalie Jeremijenko’s
	Dangling String. Applications such as these, that publish information
	in a non-intrusive or calm manner are Ambient Information Systems.


	The 1st International Workshop on the Design and Evaluation of Ambient
	Information Systems was held in Toronto, Canada, on May 13th 2007,
	in conjunction with the 5th International Conference on Pervasive
	Computing. The goal of this workshop was to bring researchers together
	to discuss this domain of growing interest in both pervasive computing
	and human-computer interaction. This domain is described by mechanisms
	that are minimally attended and perceivable from outside the range
	of a person’s direct attention, providing pre-attentive processing
	without being overly distracting. Developing new technologies such
	as these poses new and difficult challenges. These technologies display
	information outside of a person’s direct attention, which is a space
	that is not currently well understood, making it difficult to evaluate
	their effectiveness. A great deal of care is required to design studies
	which accurately observe the effect of ambient devices, particularly
	since the test subjects are not meant to observe them directly. After
	all, how does one provide a subject with a device and say, "I want
	you to use this, but please do not think about it?" Our workshop
	sought to gather perspectives from researchers in the field on these
	and other problems. Eleven excellent submissions were accepted which
	describe works-in-progress, frameworks, taxonomies, methodologies,
	evaluation paradigms, and case studies, and are published here.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Much recent research has focused on using situations rather than individual
	pieces of context as a means to trigger adaptive system behaviour.
	While current research on situations emphasises their representation
	and composition, they do not provide an approach on how to organise
	and identify their occurrences efficiently. This paper describes
	how lattice theory can be utilised to organise situations, which
	reflects the internal structure of situations such as generalisation
	and dependence. We claim that situation lattices will prove beneficial
	in identifying situations, and maintaining the consistency and integrity
	of situations. They will also help in resolving the uncertainty issues
	inherent in context and situations by working with Bayesian Networks.</p>

  <p>Systems for home automation can make a vital contribution to the well-being

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Complex and dynamic working environments such as healthcare facilities
	consist of staff, patients and equipment constantly moving in response
	to changing medical requirements. Knowing the current location of
	people and equipment is essential for the smooth running of a facility,
	yet creating a global view through tracking is a challenging task.
	It is clear that many common hospital situations can be improved
	with real-time access to the various actors’ location information.
	One of the main problems with implementing such services is that
	current location based applications tend to be proprietary and the
	data generated closed. The realisation of ubiquitous location based
	services demands the exploration of hybrid models and methods that
	can utilise existing and subsequent infrastructures in novel and
	complimentary ways. We describe a number of hospital scenarios that
	use location-based services and make available all the location data
	gathered. We propose that by aggregating location data by a range
	of acquisition methods it is possible to improve the performance
	of location applications and readily adapt to the introduction of
	new location detection technologies.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>We propose that traditional case-based recommender systems can be
	improved by informing them with context data describing the user’s
	environment. We outline existing applications with similar objectives
	and describe an application of our own - Ticketyboo - which uses
	music listening preferences and context information from users’ calendars
	to recommend tickets for music concerts. This data is gathered by
	virtual sensors that monitor each user’s music player and calendar
	applications. The novelty of this approach is that context data is
	provided to Ticketyboo via a dedicated context infrastructure. This
	results in a clear separation between the providers and consumers
	of context data. By utilising context data in this way, minimal user
	input/feedback is required to guide the system since the need for
	explicit user feedback is negated.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>There is a commonly accepted need for contexts and ontologies to describe
	the vast amounts of data that are available to pervasive computing
	applications. Existing contexts and ontologies are either much generalised,
	very application specific, or inflexible. An integrated approach
	is required in which new concepts can be added and related to existing
	ones transparently. This paper describes a novel approach to the
	design of a set of contexts and ontologies for context-aware pervasive
	computing systems. It describes a Query Service, that lies between
	applications and contextual information, which complemented by the
	contexts and ontologies, offers a more powerful query answering service
	to application developers than is currently available.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Pervasive computing systems require large amounts of information to
	be available to devices in order to support context-aware applications.
	Information must be routed from the sensors that provide it to the
	applications that consume it in a timely fashion. However, the potential
	size and ad hoc nature of these environments makes the management
	of communications a non-trivial task. One proposed solution to this
	problem uses gossiping, a class of probabilistic routing protocol,
	to disseminate context information throughout the environment. Gossiping
	algorithms require far less in the way of guarantees about network
	structure, reliability, and latency than alternative approaches,
	but are unproven in real world scenarios. We describe the on-going
	development of a framework for evaluating the performance of these
	algorithms within the context of pervasive environments.</p>

  <p>Event-based systems are a popular substrate for distributing information

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Spam filtering is a particularly challenging machine learning task
	as the data distribution and concept being learned changes over time.
	It exhibits a particularly awkward form of concept drift as the change
	is driven by spammers wishing to circumvent spam filters. In this
	paper we show that lazy learning techniques are appropriate for such
	dynamically changing contexts. We present a case-based system for
	spam filtering that can learn dynamically. We evaluate its performance
	as the case-base is updated with new cases. We also explore the benefit
	of periodically redoing the feature selection process to bring new
	features into play. Our evaluation shows that these two levels of
	model update are effective in tracking concept drift.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Because of the changing nature of spam, a spam filtering system that
	uses machine learning will need to be dynamic. This suggests that
	a case-based (memory-based) approach may work well. Case-Based Reasoning
	(CBR) is a lazy approach to machine learning where induction is delayed
	to run time. This means that the case base can be updated continuously
	and new training data is immediately available to the induction process.
	In this paper we present a detailed description of such a system
	called ECUE and evaluate design decisions concerning the case representation.
	We compare its performance with an alternative system that uses Naı̈ve
	Bayes. We find that there is little to choose between the two alternatives
	in cross-validation tests on data sets. However, ECUE does appear
	to have some advantages in tracking concept drift over time.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Clearly, machine learning techniques can play an important role in
	filtering spam email because ample training data is available to
	build a robust classifier. However, spam filtering is a particularly
	challenging task as the data distribution and concept being learned
	changes over time. This is a particularly awkward form of concept
	drift as the change is driven by spammers wishing to circumvent the
	spam filters. In this paper we show that lazy learning techniques
	are appropriate for such dynamically changing contexts. We present
	a case-based system for spam filtering called ECUE that can learn
	dynamically. We evaluate its performance as the case-base is updated
	with new cases. We also explore the benefit of periodically redoing
	the feature selection process to bring new features into play. Our
	evaluation shows that these two levels of model update are effective
	in tracking concept drift.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>As e-commerce has become more popular, the problem of information
	overload has come to the fore. Recommender systems that reduce the
	information overload problem are becoming more common. However, the
	problem with many recommender systems is that they are associated
	with a high cost of learning customer preferences (in terms of cognitive
	load). We describe the Personal Travel Assistant (PTA), a flight
	recommender application that uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to overcome
	these problems.

	The PTA allows users to search multiple flights providers concurrently
	and recommends flights based on their individual travel preferences.
	These preferences are implicitly learned from observations of user
	behaviour. When the user purchases a flight, the PTA uses the selection
	of a preferred flight to discover and refine the user’s overall travel
	preferences. These preferences are stored in a user-model as sets
	of cases representing their interactions, which are used to provide
	personalised recommendations.

	The PTA makes recommendations taking into account the context in which
	the flights were offered. It uses features from the request to determine
	this context, e.g. the duration of the trip. We perform evaluations
	of contextual recommendations that support our view that user preferences
	change depending on the context of the session. We further improve
	recommendation accuracy by storing and personalising similarity measures
	in the user-model. The PTA alters the relative importance of features
	in the personal similarity measure based on implicit user feedback,
	e.g. increasing the importance of price at the cost of stop-over
	time in a multiple hop flight.

	We also investigate cooperative components to extend our recommendation
	strategies. These allow users to reuse the information learned from
	other users when they encounter new situations. However, these techniques
	are not as successful as we had hoped. We discuss these components
	in relation to other work on collaborative recommendation and suggest
	that the standard approach is unsuited to the PTA’s context-based
	recommendation strategy.

	The strength of CBR in the e-commerce domain stems from its reuse
	of the knowledge base associated with a particular application. Since
	case data may be one aspect of a company’s entire knowledge system,
	it is important to integrate case data easily within a company’s
	IT infrastructure, providing in effect a case-based view on relevant
	portions of the company knowledge base. We describe CBML, an XML-based
	Case Mark-Up Language we have developed to facilitate such integration.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Because of the changing nature of spam, a spam filtering system that
	uses machine learning will need to be dynamic. This suggests that
	a case-based (memory-based) approach may work well. Case-Based Reasoning
	(CBR) is a lazy approach to machine learning where induction is delayed
	to run time. This means that the case base can be updated continuously
	and new training data is immediately available to the induction process.
	In this paper we present a detailed description of such a system
	called ECUE and evaluate design decisions concerning the case representation.
	We compare its performance with an alternative system that uses Naı̈ve
	Bayes (NB). We find that there is little to choose between the two
	alternatives in cross-validation tests on data sets. However, ECUE
	does appear to have some advantages in tracking concept drift over
	time.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The ranking of offers is an issue in e-commerce that has received
	a lot of attention in Case-Based Reasoning research. In the absence
	of a sales assistant, it is important to provide a facility that
	will bring suitable products and services to the attention of the
	customer. In this paper we present such a facility that is part of
	a Personal Travel Assistant (PTA) for booking flights online. The
	PTA returns a large number of offers (24 on average) and it is important
	to rank them to bring the most suitable to the fore. This ranking
	is done based on similarity to previously accepted offers. It is
	a characteristic of this domain that the case-base of accepted offers
	will be small, so the learning of appropriate feature weights is
	a particular challenge. We describe a process for learning personalised
	feature weights and present an evaluation that shows its effectiveness.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>This paper describes a case-based approach to user profiling in a
	Personal Travel assistant (based on the 1998 FIPA Travel Scenario).
	The approach is novel in that the user profile is made up of a set
	of cases capturing previous interactions rather than as a single
	composite case. This has the advantage that the profile is always
	up-to-date and also allows for the borrowing of cases from similar
	users when coverage is poor. Profile data is retrieved from a database
	in an XML format and loaded into a case-retrieval net in memory.
	This case-retrieval net is then used to support the two key tasks

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>This report details the design and implementation of an artificial
	world that demonstrates Darwinian evolution. This is done using an
	agent based modelling tool called Swarm. This world is populated
	with hundreds of agents that compete with one another to survive.
	Their behavioural attributes are coded into their genes. The initial
	population consists of individuals with randomly coded genes. It
	is hoped that by exerting Darwinian evolution on this, a population
	of agents, optimally suited for survival in the world will emerge.</p>
