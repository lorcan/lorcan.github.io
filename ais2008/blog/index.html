    <h1>2008-06-03 - Website Down... and Back</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Sorry all, the website was down up to a few minutes ago. There were problems with our hosting company's data-center. From <a href="http://service-update.theplanet.com/">their website's service page</a>: "On Saturday, May 31st at 4:55pm CDT in our H1 data center, electrical gear shorted, creating an explosion and fire that knocked down three walls surrounding our electrical equipment room. Thankfully, no one was injured. In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost."
        The issues took some time to resolve fully and hopefully we won't have any problems going forward with this, apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
